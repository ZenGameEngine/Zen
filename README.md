## ðŸš§ Project Status

Zen is currently **in active development**.  
Core systems such as the renderer abstraction, event dispatcher, and particle framework are functional,  
but features like the Vulkan backend, ECS integration, and editor tooling are still in progress.

---

## âœ¨ Current Features

- Cross-platform (Windows / Linux)

- Event-driven architecture: unified event representation and dispatch system

- Priority-ordered layer stack for modular runtime management

- Input system abstraction over SDL3 keyboard/mouse states

- Time utilities for frame delta and profiling

- Logging infrastructure built on spdlog

- Renderer abstraction layer decouples high-level drawing commands from backend implementations

- Orthographic and Perspective camera

- Batch rendering support for particles
